One of the most underrated movies of bollywood. Surely a must watch for all movie lovers.
Journey of Janardan from a loafer boy to a passionate lover and finally a legendary rockstar has been marvelously portrayed.
Aside from Nargis Fakhri, everybody has outdone himself. From Ranbir's acting, Imtiaz's direction and A.R.'s music everything deserves an standing ovation. But Mohit Cauhan's singing is what completes the portrayal of the titular character.
   The film also serves as a ride to some of the scenic places of Prague and Liberec and helps to delve deeper into the life of the protagonist. The music fits with every situation and grasps its emotions completely.
   Watch it if you dont wanna miss a gem from Bollywood....
Nice romantic ðŸ‘Œ movie ðŸ˜‰. Feel blaster!!!
awesome platform to see your favourite movie <3
Loved it .Was ahead of its time and very decent movie
Decent movie but Nargis's acting just makes it unbearable to watch at times.
The best performance of Ranbir, along with a visually stunning cinematography, AR's brilliant music, Irshad Kamil's beautiful lyrics, Mohit Chauhan's best vocals and of course, Imtiaz's vision makes it a must-watch for each and every cine-lover.
I wasn't personally fond of this movie, I thought it was boring and not interesting, but the performance by Ranbir Kapoor is what makes this movie a must-watch.
The first half of the movie works decently well, but flies off the rails in the second half. The second half plays like a very extended music video, with the melodrama turned up to 11. The romantic relationship is decently developed in the first half, but again it is all totally sabotaged in the second half.
simple story creative work, i only like the sufi touch/Music
There are three great things about Rockstar. Ranbir, Rahman and Imtiaz Ali. A rock solid emotional turn by Ranbir in probably his best role so far is the highlight. He makes you as angry, sad and as happy he is on screen. Rahman spins another wonderful score that integrates seamlessly with the film and kudos to Imtiaz Ali for some stunning imagery and cinematography. But what it lacks is a powerful story. While Ranbir puts his heart and soul into the film, the story hardly supports him. The movie would have done better with a more darker tone rather than trying to infuse nonsensical Bollywood romance. Nargis Fakhri is a complete disappointment and is another reason why Ranbir's emotional upheavals look bleak. I'd rather have exchanged Aditi Rao Hydari for her role! The story combined with Nargis Fakhri's clueless performance takes the 1.5 star away from Rockstar.
