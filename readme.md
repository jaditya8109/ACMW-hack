## Know movie
## Movie Reviewer

A lot of the times when we want to watch a new release or an old classic that we haven't watched yet, we get confused as to whether the movie is actually good before watching.

Some reviews will suggest it's a good movie and others say a conflicting thing which makes it more confusing for us.
